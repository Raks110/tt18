## Welcome to Tech Tatva Web-Dev Page 

Currently, the project is only front-end oriented. The code has been written using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here are a few highlights of the project:

# Front-End

### Responsive UI
The interface adjusts itself to suit both mobile and wide-screen usage. The font sizes and container sizes decrease to increase reading efficiency and space.

### Theme Switching
Would you love to use the UI in both light and dark themes? Well, here it is. Switch on or off the lights based on your taste. _More themes are en route._ Plus, say goodbye to reloading the page to switch the theme. The theme switches automatically, saving all your form-entered data as well!

### Always-on Tabs
With both categories of logging on always visible on the screen, switching between them and logging in is made easier than ever.

### Beautiful Interface
With _AMOLED-friendly_ and _sunlight-friendly_ interfaces to switch between plus the _translucent UI_ add up to the page's readability, usability and user-friendliness.

# Back-End

Coming Soon...
